## What is medical tourism?
Medical tourism is when a person travels overseas to obtain medical, dental, or surgical care, while simultaneously enjoying this trip as a leisure vacation. Medical tourists are usually looking for a more budget-friendly, accessible, yet professional treatment. Most patients traveling abroad are seeking cancer treatments, cosmetic and plastic surgeries, fertility treatment, and bariatric surgery.

Iran also has medical tourists visiting from more developed countries who are mostly looking for cosmetic, life-altering procedures including but not limited to the highly popular rhinoplasty, bariatric surgery, plastic surgery, hair transplantation, breast surgery, and gastric sleeves or bypasses.
